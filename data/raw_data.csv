Equally appropriate is the proliferation of hotels and boarding houses, ancillaries to the twin monoliths in the area, Olympia and Earls Court Exhibition Halls. Covering all standards of accommodation, they are perhaps the sole unifying element of this postcode.  Facilities in W14 are very much geared for visitors. Slap bang in the middle of W14 is the cavernous Kensington Olympia, built in 1884 and able to supply a gargantuan 37,000 square metres of exhibition space split between its three constituent halls. In recent decades it has had to play second fiddle to the even larger Earls Court Hall - just over the border in SW5 - but with both places now owned by the same firm the two quite happily complement each other.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/hosting/Hosting-1382610804137208946/original/1afe640b-b686-49b3-8feb-2e36b8d2531c.jpeg,677492296,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/677492296,Emin,07/02/2025,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Been living in London for over 20 years and I love the city!,within a day,80%,27%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/e1bacbf9-2be2-4038-86fb-d42cb4219e82.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/e1bacbf9-2be2-4038-86fb-d42cb4219e82.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Hammersmith,2,2.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Wandsworth,,51.45344342,-0.188872777,Private room in condo,Private room,2,1,1 shared bath,3.0,3,"[""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Washer"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""First aid kit"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Wifi"", ""Kitchen"", ""Paid parking on premises""]",$62.00,1.0,365,1,1,365,365,1.0,365.0,,t,27,56,83,358,11/06/2025,0,0,0,197,0,0,0.0,01/02/2012,14/11/2024,4.85,4.79,4.62,4.87,4.9,4.87,4.74,,f,2,0,2,0,0.25,,,,,,,,,

I am endlessly curious. I love to experience the world with eyes wide open. I never stop exploring, discovering and evolving.

Likewise, I love Science, the Arts, and creative people. Life to me is a storybook full of fascinating tales. I amass information 'on the hoof' and very little passes me by. Understanding what makes others tick is meat and drink to me and proves to be a source of endless joy.

I always keep my mind active. I love beauty in all forms, I am well-educated, and I like to remain totally classless. This makes it easy for me to get on with just about any sort of person. I am thought-provoking and even quite deep on occasions. I also get involved in other exciting things which keep me busy too, such as painting, reading books, newspaper and cultural magazines, photography, video editing, cycling, theatre, music, and movies.

Furthermore, I strongly believe a very clean, secure, welcoming feel, and comfortable apartment is of paramount importance for travellers.

My life's golden rule is to treat others as you wish to be treated!

I am always on an adventure. Enjoy hearing about people's travels and lifestyles.

You may want to know that I am a very responsive host, so if you encounter any issues while staying in my properties, I very much appreciate you to address them straight away and give me the chance to fix them.

 I am a seasoned traveller and know what it's like to find decent and reasonable accommodation in foreign lands! I have found that staying with the 'locals' gives you a wonderfully unique and rewarding prospective of new cities and places..  I have lived in Rio de Jeneiro, Brazil, and have travelled to India, Australia, Indonesia, Bali and Hawaii.  In New Zealand I stayed in a wonderful 'Home stay' and also in a tee pee in a national park.  I once run a small hotel in Cyprus, so I know how to make sure that my guests get the best out of their stay with me.

I am social, with good boundaries, and like to keep a tranquil home, I love cooking and am rather good at it, I just applied for next years Masterchef, 
I enjoy camping and have my own camper-van, nothing beats sitting round the campfire, gazing at the stars, and sleeping under canvas.
I am , writer a 'Life coach' , NLP Master Practitioner and Reiki healer. We have a lovely calm dog  'Yogi' , who is a very friendly non moulting breed- poodle springer spaniel mix. He is not allowed into the bedrooms. 

The house is clean and tidy, and we are a friendly, helpful and joyful bunch.

I am easy going, enjoy interior design, and love meeting new people, i make my own soap, and creams and am into a healthy eating, and organic food.

My hope is that our guests will enjoy, the friendly atomosphere of our home, and perhaps become life long friends of ours.
I look forward to making your staying with us unique and informative.",within an hour,92%,77%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/6f283bcf-0d3e-4608-8d81-37096327d104.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/6f283bcf-0d3e-4608-8d81-37096327d104.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,LB of Enfield,2,4.0,['phone'],t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Tower Hamlets,,51.50106217,-0.020231079,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,3,1,1 bath,1.0,1,"[""Washer"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Wifi"", ""Kitchen""]",$90.00,2.0,365,2,2,365,365,2.0,365.0,,t,3,10,26,171,12/06/2025,4,4,3,124,0,37,3330.0,05/05/2025,11/06/2025,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.75,5.0,5.0,,f,2,2,0,0,3.08,,,,,,,,,

Whether you’re a rocker, cool kid, metalhead, hippy, vintage queen or muso, you’ll find something to delight you in this fun part of North London!<br /><br />The moment you step outside the tube station, Camden attacks the senses. Bass thumps from the market stalls' speakers, the scent of street food and incense permeates the air, and goths, punks, pushers and tourists shove past, giving the area an unorthodox charm. Camden Market has been one of the main draws of Camden for decades.

I returned to London in my early 20's and have lived between both every since.  I love to travel, most recently Canada which is a mecca for food ""I didn't know that"".  I plan to revisit South America  and tick more places off as soon as I can, it's vast and I need to explore it all.  I also have a half baked plan for a Camper Van odyssey around Aus/NZ one of these days. I love experiencing new cultures and places, chatting to global souls and visiting the local haunts with my camera taking memories and cooking and tasting the food.  I am a photographer, writer, musician,  interiors, architecture and design freak and sometimes a Program Manager/Analyst Programmer/Troubleshooter who likes meeting new people, learning new skills, exploring and stepping outside of my comfort zone.  I love to stay with locals when I travel as it gives you a different experience and makes you feel more part of a place. I love London and I try to welcome all of my guests and make them feel like they are at home, a local if you like!.  I have walked all over London and love to guide people to hidden places, so if you have any questions about my hometown then feel free to ask, I will try my best to furnish you with the answers.  I seek to make my guests experience of London and UK special, whether you are a solo or a couple of traveller(s) all are welcome.  My house is not a hotel, it’s a home and I open it up when I can to allow others to experience local London.

I have lived in London for over 5 years now, and becoming a host has been my best decision. I work in the culinary industry as a Chef and currently, have decided to take a job in an infamous restaurant in Brussels. Therefore, by being a host, I am able to make use of my space efficiently. My other hobbies include horseback riding, board games and of course travelling. As a traveller myself, I understand the struggle of finding the perfect place to stay at, which is I why have decided to host as well. I find it incredibly inspiring to be of help to others whilst having the opportunity to meet people from all across the world! 

Consequently, I decided that Airbnb is a great opportunity to be useful for travellers that come to tour and explore the incredible London. In my profile, you will be able to find a selection of accommodations to choose from based on your liking. I hope you enjoy your stay whilst I will try to provide you with immediate assistance to ensure that you have an outstanding trip!

I'm naomi, im a primary school teacher of 4 year olds in Brixton, so am often away during school holidays. I live with my lovely husband Dave who is an actor so often away with work. We love our little flat and would like to share it with others. It would be yours, without us in it of course!  I really hate the thought of it being left empty, plus it means someone can feed our fish for us! (if thats ok?!)

We are both film goers and love watching dvds, (theres a fair collection here you can use!), and often go to the local independent cinema just down the road which we are members of. We're massive foodies and Brixton is AMAZING for eating out in. Im regularly seen in the village, munching my way through all the little eateries and seem to know most of the owners...not sure if thats down to me eating there so regularly or my chatty nature! We both love brixton, it has  a great buzzy atmosphere, and a wander through the market is great fun. We both enjoy seeing other cities and love to people watch!

I'm Aleks. I'm originally from the US but lived in the UK for 20 years. I was in London for three of those, and absolutely love this city.

I also love this flat! It's so close to The Guardian newspaper offices (in the dynamic and delicious Kings Place venue on Regent's Canal), where I was the host of Tech Weekly, their technology podcast, for eight years, and where I have written columns and features about the social implications of the web. My first book was published by Guardian Books in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , and is called Untangling the Web: What the Internet Is Doing to You.

The flat is also only 20 minutes away from the BBC on Regent's Street, where you can hear The Digital Human, a series on Radio 4, about who we are in the digital age.

It's also a 15 minute cycle ride to the LSE, where I was a Visiting Fellow in the Media and Communications department researching the little things the web assumes about us when we use sites like (Hidden by Airbnb) and (Hidden by Airbnb) . For it, I created something called The Serendipity Engine.

I'm a foodie, and love to cook. You can tell this by the cookware I have in the kitchen :) I am a big fan of the new branch of Caravan in the fabulous Granary Square around the corner, and love the street food revolution that's epitomised by _KERB, which is open around the corner every weekday on Kings Boulevard. My favourite restaurant in London, though, is a vegetarian joint, Mildred's in Soho.

I also love exploring this city, using books like Richard Barrett's Medical Walks of London or Peter Ackroyd's London: A Biography as a guide.

I'm currently in Brooklyn, working and living in a whole new city and time zone. 

I'm a voracious traveller; I was born in Malaysia to Polish-American parents, grew up in New Orleans, spent five years living just outside LA (though it's where most of my family still live), went to high school in Washington D.C., and college at Oberlin, in Ohio. I moved to the UK because I fell in love when I was studying abroad in Glasgow, Scotland. That relationship didn't last, but my love for the country remains.

I've lived in Glasgow where I learned to drink beer and eat haggis. I've lived in Leamington Spa near Birmingham in the Midlands where I discovered great curry and the cycle paths and canals that criss cross the country. I lived in Guildford where I got my MSc and PhD in Social Psychology. I've lived in Brighton where I began to play beach volleyball competitively on the national tour. And I lived in London, where I ran on the canal, ate good food, consumed local culture and generally loved the view. I've also done stints in Florence, Italy and Paris, France. Next up: Paris again. Or Tokyo for the (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Olympics. Who knows?

Anything by Dickens. Hardy, Thackery. Love playing tennis if you can't find me that's where I'll be. I play the piano and sometimes it's available for guests to play.  I enjoy music by Debussy fave is Claire De Lune, and Rachmaninov though I only listen to his stuff its too hard for me to play!
I am a retired psychotherapist. I loved working with people seeing them healing and growing their self esteem .
I enjoy movies and usually go once a week if not more. I enjoy thrillers such as 'Taken'  but also enjoy a more gentle tale. Life of Pi was a remarkable yet beautiful film which I enjoyed more than the book.
As a host I am warm friendly and welcoming.  As a guest I'm considerate and respectful. 
My favourite travel destination is New York such an exciting vibrant city. For a more carefree sunshine holiday I love Spain, or France.  The farthest I've traveled was to Australia to visit relatives a long time ago so may go again. I thought Sydney was pretty cool!   Enjoy cooking if I'm in the mood but sometimes I let someone else do the cooking! I'll eat almost anything I'm not a fussy eater! But I do enjoy smoked salmon with champagne! Sea food love it!  I enjoy the theatre and opera and ballet.  All time fave is Romeo and Juliet with music by Prokofiev and choreography by Kenneth Macmillan I weep through most of it!!!!
